When I visit an admin shelter show page

In that section, I see a list of all pets for this shelter that have a pending application and have not yet been marked "approved" or "rejected"

26. Action Required Links to Application Show Page

When I visit an admin shelter show page
And I look in the "Action Required" section
Then next to each pet's name I see a link to the admin application show page where I can accept or reject the pet.
